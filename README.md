# Roulette

This application runs a statistics experiment.

Given you have 38 options to pick on a roulette table:
The Game automatically calculates the exact wager amount to run the cycle 38 times while taking the total out of you Bank Total.

Statistically speaking the number should be called in each session, considering it has a 1:38 each spin but as we all know it is not 100% guaranteed. 

This game allows you to experiment spin per spin in a high frequency to see what could happen 100s of spins in just a few seconds which would take hours on a true Roulette Table.

Although the main focus of the application is the auotmatically calculated wager based off of the bank total, I did include functionality for you to edit you Bank Balance and wager amount. So have fun and don't let Will Ferrel see you broke.

## Future Dev

I have only include functionality for on number to be selected at a time in this experiment.

In the future I would like to have the full functionality of a Roulette board.
